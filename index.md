Personal finance is an intimidating jungle filled with jargon, exceptions, and potential fees if you're not careful.  
But fear not. I'm here to be your tour guide and navigator.

After reading this guide, you will be familiar with the basics of four areas of personal finance that will set you on the path to self-sufficiency. If you're a new college grad, this will be particularly useful as you enter the "real world".

* **[Cash]({{ site.base_url }}/cash)**: saving your money in checking and savings accounts
* **[Credit]({{ site.base_url }}/credit)**: building your reliability as a borrower through credit cards and loans
* **[Investing]({{ site.base_url }}/investing)**: saving for retirement and building wealth over the long term
* **[Taxes]({{ site.base_url }}/taxes)**: file in a matter of an hour by cutting through the bureaucratic nightmare

### Who are you, and why should I listen to you?

Hi, and thanks for stopping by! My name is [Onkur Sen](https://onkursen.com). I'll be a software engineer at [Robinhood](http://robinhood.com), and I'm finishing my Masters in computer science from Stanford.

I've been interested in personal finance for about 3 years, and I wanted to present everything I've learned from books, blogs, and articles in an easy-to-understand guide that I wish I had when I graduated from college.

I hope you find it useful! If you have any feedback, feel free to [email](mailto:onkursen@gmail.com) or [tweet](http://twitter.com/onkursen) me.
