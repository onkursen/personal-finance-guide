After setting up your bank accounts, the next step in your path to financial self-sufficiency is to **build credit**. This space is riddled with terminology, so let's break that down first.

### A jargon introduction

As used in the financial world, **credit** refers to your dependability in borrowing money. The better your credit, the more money you can borrow with the trust that you will pay it back later.

Here are a few commonly-used terms associated with credit:

* A **line of credit** is any source of credit that is given to you by a financial institution. Some common examples are credit cards and loans (for vehicles, houses, tuition, etc.).
* A **credit limit** is the highest balance you can carry on a line of credit at any point in time. As you approach your credit limit, you want to pay back part of all of the money owed so that you can make future transactions.
* A **credit bureau** (also known as a consumer reporting agency) is an agency that provides a history of your reliability for your lines of credit. There are three major credit bureaus in the US:
  * TransUnion
  * Experian
  * Equifax
* A **credit score** is a measure of how dependable you are as a borrower. It is usually issued by a credit bureau.
* A **credit report** is a detailed report of your credit history that is provided by a credit bureau.
* A lender will file an **inquiry** to look at your credit report when deciding whether to give you money or credit. There are two types of inquiries:
  * **Hard inquiries** stay on your credit report for two years.
  * **Soft inquiries** (which are often used for getting credit scores) do not show up on your credit report.

### Your goal: build credit.

In general, the simple way to build credit is to follow two rules:

* Buy enough stuff, but not too much.
* **Always pay your bills in full and on time.**

That itself doesn't say very much, though. There are two ways through which you can build credit:


* The most intuitive way of building credit is through **loans**, where a bank lends you money as credit with the understanding that you pay it back over time. This applies not only to loans for a car or a house, but also to student loans that you may have taken out while in school!
* A significantly easier method of building credit is with **credit cards**. In this case, an institution usually allows you to make purchases with a card up to a certain amount (the credit limit), and you pay a monthly bill for the amount you have spent on the card. This is known as **revolving credit** as the bank is not lending you a fixed amount of money, but rather is setting a cap on how much you can borrow at a time. If you pay some of the debt off, you can then borrow more.


As each person's financial situation is different, not everyone may be looking to take out loans after they graduate. For example, someone who lives in an urban area with high public transportation availability may not need a car. Therefore, I'll focus on credit cards as the more universal method of building credit.

### Applying for your first credit card

Assuming you currently have no open lines of credit (i.e., you have no credit history), the first step to building credit is to apply for a basic credit card that will not affect your spend habits and will allow you to build a credit history.

A good first credit card will have the following features:

* High acceptance rate (i.e., no credit score or history requirements)
* No annual fee (so you can keep it open without worries to build your credit history)
* 0% APR (so you can carry a balance if absolutely necessary; I **DO NOT** recommend doing this!)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle bills online
* Good customer service with high availability
* No foreign transaction fee
* Allows you to view your credit score (so you can see how you are building credit over time)

I personally recommend the **[Discover It For Students](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/student/discoverit.html** credit card as it satisfies all of the requirements listed above.

Once you have your first credit card, you should *keep it open for about a year* before you apply for other credit cards to ensure you have a stable credit history.

### Monitoring your credit score and credit report

Now that you have your first credit card, you have begun building a credit history. Furthermore, you now have a **credit score** that measures how dependable you are as a borrower. Your next goal should be to regularly pay off your bills in full and on time to build credit and increase your credit score.

Your credit score is affected by the following factors:

* High impact
  * Credit card utilization: try to keep to below 20% of limit
  * Payment history: always pay on time
  * Derogatory marks: don't get bankrupt
* Medium impact
  * Average age of credit history
  * Total number of accounts
* Low impact
  * Credit inquiries

To monitor how well you are building your credit, you can check your credit score with each of the three major bureaus for free with these online tools:

* [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) for TransUnion
* [Credit Sesame](http://www.creditsesame.com) for Experian
* [Quizzle](https://www.quizzle.com/) for Equifax

Furthermore, each agency will provide you one free credit report per year, which you can obtain through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com). You should do this every year and check your report for any discrepancies.

### Applying for more credit cards

After you have established a stable credit history for about a year, it's a good idea to apply for more credit cards to improve your credit history and score. As credit card utilization has a high impact on your score and total number of accounts has a medium impact, your score will go up.

**Note**: An important thing to know about applying for credit cards is that each application will cause your score to temporarily dip by 2-5 points. However, after a few months, your score should go back up to the same or even a higher level assuming you are financially responsible.

When choosing which cards to apply for, there are a few basic questions that you should consider:

* Do you mind paying an annual fee?
* Do you prefer cash back, airline miles, or rewards points?
* If you prefer rewards points, do you plan on redeeming them for travel?
* Will you be traveling internationally?

There are many credit cards out there that are targeted towards different financial audiences. However, I personally recommend the following two credit cards because they can be catered to anyone's spending habits.

* The [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card.aspx) is perhaps the top travel rewards card out there. It is a [Visa Signature](https://usa.visa.com/visasignature/) card with an annual fee of $95 that is waived the first year. It earns 2x points on travel and dining and 1x points on all other purchases and you can get a 25% bonus when you redeem points for travel (i.e., a cumulative rewards rate of 2.5%/1.25%). Furthermore, you can earn a signup bonus of *40000 points after spending $4000 in the first 3 months*.

<!-- 
* The [Barclaycard Arrival Plus](http://www.barclaycardarrival.com/arrival-plus/) is an excellent all-around card for everyday spend. It is a [World Elite Mastercard](http://www.mastercard.us/credit-card-world-elite.html) with an annual fee of $89 that is waived the first year. It earns 2% cash back on *all purchases*, and you can get a 10% bonus when you redeem points for travel (i.e., a cumulative cash back rate of 2.2%). Furthermore, you can earn a signup bonus of *40000 points after spending $3000 in the first 3 months*.

* [Million Mile Secrets: How to Redeem Barclaycard Arrival Plus Points for Travel](http://millionmilesecrets.com/2014/07/02/redeem-barclays-arrival-points-for-travel/)
-->

In addition to the benefits listed above and detailed in the supplemental articles, an important thing to note about these two cards is that they are Visa and Mastercard, respectively, meaning **they will be accepted almost everywhere**.

A note about the *signup bonuses* for these two cards:

* For the Chase Sapphire Preferred, the 40000 points is worth at least $500 when you redeem for travel.
* For the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, the 40000 points is worth $440 when you redeem for travel.

In both cases, **the signup bonus alone offsets almost 5 years worth of the annual fee**.

After getting these two cards, you can always apply for additional cards. However, these two credit cards along with the Discover It for Students and your debit cards from Chase and Schwab form a solid foundation for accessing your money, building your credit history, and of course, making purchases.
