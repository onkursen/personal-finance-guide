After setting up your bank accounts, the next step in your path to financial self-sufficiency is to **build credit**. This area is riddled with terminology, so let's break that down first.

### A jargon introduction

As used in the financial world, **credit** refers to your dependability in borrowing money. The better your credit, the more money you can borrow with the trust that you will pay it back later.

Here are a few commonly-used terms associated with credit:

* A **line of credit** is any source of credit that is given to you by a financial institution. Some common examples are credit cards and loans (for vehicles, houses, tuition, etc.).
* A **credit limit** is the highest balance you can carry on a line of credit. As you approach your credit limit, you want to pay back part of all of the money owed so that you can make future transactions.
* A **credit bureau** (also known as a consumer reporting agency) is an agency that provides a history of your reliability for your lines of credit. The US has three major bureaus: TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax.
* A **credit score** is a measure of how dependable you are as a borrower. It is usually issued by a credit bureau.
* A **credit report** is a detailed report of your credit history that is provided by a credit bureau.
* A lender will file an **inquiry** to look at your credit report when deciding whether to give you money or credit. There are two types of inquiries:
  * **Hard inquiries** stay on your credit report for two years.
  * **Soft inquiries** (which are often used for getting credit scores) do not show up on your credit report.

### Your goal: build credit.

Do this by following two rules:

* Spend less than you earn.
* Pay your bills in full and on time.

More specifically, there are two mechanisms of establishing and building creditworthiness:

* The most intuitive way is to take **loans**, where a bank lends you money as credit with the understanding that you pay it back over time. Common examples include home mortgages, car loans, and student loans.
* A significantly easier method is to apply for and use **credit cards**. In this case, an institution usually allows you to make purchases with a card up to a certain amount (the credit limit), and you pay a monthly bill for the amount you have spent on the card. This is known as **revolving credit** as the bank is not lending you a fixed amount of money, but rather is setting a cap on how much you can borrow at a time. If you pay some of the debt off, you can then borrow more.

As each person's financial situation is different, not everyone may be looking to take out loans after they graduate. For example, someone who lives in an urban area with high public transportation availability may not need a car. Therefore, I'll focus on credit cards as the more universal method of building credit.

### Applying for your first credit card

Assuming you currently have no open lines of credit (i.e., you have no credit history), the first step to building credit is to apply for a basic credit card that will not affect your spend habits and will allow you to build a credit history.

A good first credit card will have the following features:

* High application acceptance rate (i.e., no credit score or history requirements)
* No annual fee (so you can keep it open without worries to build your credit history)
* 0% APR (so you can carry a balance if absolutely necessary; I **DO NOT** recommend doing this!)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and pay bills online
* Good customer service with high availability
* No foreign transaction fees

I personally recommend the **[Discover It For Students](http://bit.ly/1OA9TQq)** credit card as it satisfies all of the requirements listed above.

Once you have your first credit card, keep it open and use it regularly for about **one year** before you apply for other credit cards to ensure you have a stable credit history.

### Monitoring your credit score and credit report

Now that you have your first credit card, you have begun building a credit history. Furthermore, you now have a **credit score** that measures how dependable you are as a borrower. Your next goal should be to regularly pay off your bills in full and on time to build credit and increase your credit score.

Your credit score is affected by the following factors:

* High impact
  * Credit card utilization: keep your balance below 20% of your limit
  * Payment history: always pay on time
  * Derogatory marks: don't get bankrupt
* Medium impact
  * Average age of credit history: the longer, the better
  * Total number of accounts: the more, the better
* Low impact
  * Credit inquiries: the fewer, the better

You can check your credit score with each of the three major bureaus for free once a week with these online tools:

* [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) for TransUnion and Equifax
* [Credit Sesame](http://www.creditsesame.com) for Experian

Furthermore, each bureau will provide you one free credit report per year at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com). Check your report for any discrepancies.

### Applying for more credit cards

After you have established a stable credit history for about a year, it's a good idea to apply for more credit cards to improve your credit history and score. As credit card utilization has a high impact on your score and total number of accounts has a medium impact, your score will go up over time.

Importantly, each credit card application will cause your score to *temporarily* dip by 2-5 points. However, after a few months, your score should go back up to the same or even a higher level assuming you are financially responsible.

When choosing which cards to apply for, there are a few basic questions that you should consider:

* Do you mind paying an annual fee?
* Do you prefer cash back, airline miles, or rewards points?
* If you prefer rewards points, do you plan on redeeming them for travel?
* Will you be traveling internationally?

There are many credit cards out there that are targeted towards different financial audiences. However, after talking to many new grads, I almost always recommend two cards together because they can be catered to anyone's spending habits.

### The one-size-fits-most case: Chase Sapphire Preferred + Chase Freedom

If you want an outstanding value, a lucrative earning opportunity, and an ability to use points both for cash back and for travel, then this set is for you.

The [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card.aspx) is a premium travel rewards card. The highlights are:

* Annual fee: $95 waived the first year
* Signup bonus/minimum spend requirement: 50000 points after spending $4000 in 3 months
* Earning: 2 points/dollar on travel/dining, 1 point/dollar otherwise
* No foreign transaction fees
* Minor bling factor: the card is made of hard metal that makes for a flashy entrance

The [Chase Freedom](https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?PID=CFFD2&SPID=FJF6&CELL=600G&MSC=1514674244) is an everyday spending card that makes a great complement to the Sapphire Preferred. The highlights are:

* Annual fee: $0
* Signup bonus/minimum spend requirement: $150 (i.e., 15000 points) after spending $500 in 3 months
* Earning: 5 points/$ on [different categories each quarter](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/calendarreminder)
* *Has* foreign transaction fees

#### Why these points matter

You can redeem these points in one of 3 ways:

* Cash back: 1 point = 1 cent. This is the worst option.
* Buy travel: 1 point = 1.25 cents. This allows you to "pay" for a flight with points and then earn frequent flier miles as if you were paying with cash
* Transfer to travel partners: 1 pt = 1 pt/mile (transfer in multiples of 1000). This allows you to transfer to airlines (Southwest, United, British Airways) and hotels and redeem for award flights. This is usually the most lucrative option and if you time things right, you can get a value of 2-3 cents/pt.

However, the last two options are only possible if you have the Sapphire Preferred! If you just have the Freedom, you can only redeem for cash back. Also, the spending categories for the two cards complement each other, so they're a great "starter kit" for people getting into the world of credit cards and want something practical and easy to use.

### If you really don't care about points: Chase Freedom + Citi Double Cash

If you prefer simplicity and are strongly opinionated about getting cash back explicitly, then this set will be a great place to start.

The [Chase Freedom](https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?PID=CFFD2&SPID=FJF6&CELL=600G&MSC=1514674244) is actually a great cashback card in its own right. Again, the highlights are:

* Annual fee: $0
* Signup bonus/minimum spend requirement: $150 after spending $500 in 3 months
* Earning: 5 cents/dollar on [different categories each quarter](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom/calendarreminder)
* *Has* foreign transaction fees

The [Citi Double Cash](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card) card is a solid card for everyday use that earns a uniform 2% rate on all purchases. The highlights are:

* Annual fee: $0
* Signup bonus/minimum spend requirement: None
* Earning: 2 cents/dollar on all purchases
* *Has* foreign transaction fees

### Summary

* Understand the jargon used in the world of credit and the different ways in which credit can be built.
* Open a first credit card like the [Discover It For Students](http://bit.ly/1OA9TQq) to establish credit.
* Monitor your credit score with [Credit Karma](https://www.creditkarma.com) and [Credit Sesame](http://www.creditsesame.com)
* After about a year, apply for a set of two cards to build your credit and to earn valuable points/cash back on your purchases:
  * For most people, the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/sapphire-preferred-card.aspx) and [Chase Freedom](https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?PID=CFFD2&SPID=FJF6&CELL=600G&MSC=1514674244) provide a good one-two punch that allows you to use points for cash back or travel.
  * For those who only care about cash back explicitly, the [Chase Freedom](https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?PID=CFFD2&SPID=FJF6&CELL=600G&MSC=1514674244) and [Citi Double Cash](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card) provide a solid base to cover most purchases.
