Cash is the backbone of your personal financial plan. Before considering entering the worlds of credit or investing, it's important to have a solid handle on the actual money that's coming in and going out. Enter the **bank account**, a place to securely store your money. In particular, you should have two types of bank accounts open: a checking account and a savings account.

### Checking accounts

A checking account should serve as the primary gateway for all money coming in. For example, any income should first be deposited in the checking account before being spent or moving to the savings account. You should also use the checking account to pay bills.

A good checking account will have the following qualities:

* Few/no maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements
* Debit card linked to the checking account to use while making purchases
* High availability/access to ATMs to withdraw money (preferably with no fees)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle bills online

There are a few checking accounts available to all that stand out among the crowd: the Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account, the Aspiration Summit Account, and Simple. All three meet the first three requirements above.

**A cautionary note before proceeding**: these accounts are able to offer enticing benefits by mostly eliminating physical branches. Thus, it may be convenient to open a checking account with a bank commonly available in your geographical area in addition to or in lieu of one of these recommended accounts.

I'll start with [Simple](https://www.simple.com/) because, well, it's simple. It has access to [a network of over 55000 ATMs](https://www.simple.com/atms) in the United States where you can withdraw money fee-free. However, it shines in its web and mobile interface, which allow you to conveniently see your activity in real time, make savings goals, pay bills, and more.

<!-- TODO: is there a credit check for Simple? -->

The **[Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account](https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account)** is my preferred account because it comes with a Visa debit card that offers a **refund on any ATM fee worldwide** (Million Mile Secrets has [an article thoroughly discussing this](http://millionmilesecrets.com/2014/05/13/charles-schwab-debit-card/)). Furthermore, customer service by phone is very professional and available 24/7. Thus, this account is very useful for people who are always on the go. However, applying for the Schwab checking account will also result in a hard inquiry on your credit report (more on this in the Credit section).

Lastly, a newcomer to the checking account space is the [Aspiration Summit Account](https://my.aspiration.com/app/token/referral/XPVGH89ZQTFL5CU6). It offers all of the benefits of the Schwab account but also offers a high interest rate compared to most checking accounts: 1% if the balance is at least $2500, 0.25% otherwise. However, it is less established and may be clunkier to use than the Schwab account.

### Savings accounts

A savings account serves as a place to store away money that you want to save for the future and for emergencies. You should have money sit here and build interest. Your interactions with the savings account should primarily be one-way, i.e., money is transferred into the savings account from the checking account, but not vice versa. However, in case of an emergency, you can pull money from the savings back into the checking.

A good savings account will have the following qualities:

* Few/no maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements
* High interest rates (so your money can grow while it sits in the account)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle transfers online
* Fast processing times for transfers (preferably less than 3 business days)

I personally recommend the **[Discover Online Savings Account](https://www.discover.com/online-banking/savings-account/)** because:

* It has no maintenance fees.
* It has a high interest rate (0.95% at the time of writing).
* It has an intuitive web and mobile interface.
* Transfers from external accounts usually take a quick 2 days to post.

Another good option is the **[Ally Online Savings Account](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/)**. I personally haven't used this account, but it has a high interest rate (1% at the time of writing) and shines in its ability to create subsavings accounts that you can designate for different purposes or goals (e.g., emergency fund or saving for a wedding).
