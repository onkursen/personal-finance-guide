# The New Grad's Guide to Personal Finance

**Note**: I mention financial tools and products in this guide. I do *NOT* receive any compensation for doing so; my preferred tools are purely from my positive experiences. This is also not financial advice and is meant for informational purposes only.

----------

## Goals

This is a no-frills guide to allow a new college grad or someone who is not familiar with personal finance to reach a comfortable level of self-sufficiency.

More explicitly, after following this guide, you should be knowledgeable about the following aspects of personal finance:

* Keeping your money in checking and savings accounts
* Building credit through loans and a minimal number of credit cards
* Filing and paying taxes
* Making charitable donations
* Saving for retirement with a 401k and/or IRA

----------

## Bank accounts: a place for your money

A bank account is the fundamental component of your financial arsenal because it gives you a place to securely store your money. In particular, you should have two types of bank accounts open: a checking account and a savings account.

### Checking accounts

A **checking account** should serve as the primary gateway for all money coming in. For example, any income should first be deposited in the checking account before being spent or moving to the savings account. You should also use the checking account to pay bills.

A good checking account will have the following qualities:

* High responsiveness (transactions post quickly)
* Few/no maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements
* High availability/access to ATMs to withdraw money (preferably with no fees)
* Debit card linked to the checking account to use while making purchases
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle bills online
* *Optional*: Physical proximity to a branch if that is important to you

I personally recommend two checking accounts for different purposes:

* The **[Chase Student Checking Account][1]** is a strong account because:
    * It has no fees for students aged 17-24.
    * It is extremely responsive; transactions post nearly instantly.
    * It comes with a Visa debit card.
    * Chase has a large network of branches and ATMs.
* The **[Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking Account][2]** is an excellent checking account because:
    * It has no maintenance fees or minimum balance requirements.
    * It offers a refund on all ATM fees.
    * It comes with a Visa debit card with no foreign transaction fees, so it will be accepted everywhere.
    * Customer service by phone is very professional and available 24/7.

**Bottom line**: The Chase Checking is better as a primary checking account because of its responsiveness and wide availability of branches. The Schwab Checking is better for use on the go because it can be used to withdraw money at any ATM and its debit card will be accepted anywhere that takes cards as payment (Million Mile Secrets has [an article thoroughly discussing this][3]).
    
### Savings accounts

A **savings account** serves as a place to store away money that you want to save for the future and for emergencies. You should have money sit here and build interest. Your interactions with the savings account should primarily be one-way, i.e., money is transferred into the savings account from the checking account, but not vice versa. However, in case of an emergency, you can pull money from the savings back into the checking.

A good savings account will have the following qualities:

* Few/no maintenance fees and minimum balance requirements
* High interest rates (so your money can grow while it sits in the account)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle transfers online
* Fast processing times for transfers (preferably less than 3 business days)

I personally recommend the **[Discover Online Savings Account][4]** because:

* It has no maintenance fees.
* It has a high interest rate (0.85% at the time of writing).
* It has an intuitive web and mobile interface.
* Transfers from external accounts usually take a quick 2 days to post.

----------

## Pause: how do I keep track of all of this?

When you have a lot of personal information diversified across different institutions with their own different accounts, it's easy to lose track of things quickly. Luckily, there are a few tools that can significantly simplify this process for you:

* **[Mint][5]** is a website allows you to link your bank accounts, credit cards, loans, or other financial accounts so that you can keep track of your finances in a central place. You can see your past transactions, see spending habits, set savings goals, and much more. This is an essential tool for anyone who wants to stay on top of their personal finances.
* A **password manager** is useful for keeping track of account information easily and securely. I use [KeePassX][6] because it is free, simple, lightweight, and cross-platform. Other popular tools include [1Password][7] and [LastPass][8].
* An **encrypted disk image** is handy for safely keeping your sensitive electronic documents. For any documents I receive in the mail, I simply scan them and then shred them after storing them in my disk image.
    * If you use Windows, consider using [BitLocker][9].
    * If you use Mac, you can use [Disk Utility's native ability to create encrypted disk images][10].

----------

## Entering the land of credit

After setting up your bank accounts, the next step in your path to financial self-sufficiency is to **build credit**. This space is riddled with terminology, so let's break that down first.

### A jargon introduction

As used in the financial world, **credit** refers to your dependability in borrowing money. The better your credit, the more money you can borrow with the trust that you will pay it back later.

Here are a few commonly-used terms associated with credit:

* A **line of credit** is any source of credit that is given to you by a financial institution. Some common examples are credit cards and loans (for vehicles, houses, tuition, etc.).
* A **credit limit** is the highest balance you can carry on a line of credit at any point in time. As you approach your credit limit, you want to pay back part of all of the money owed so that you can make future transactions.
* A **credit bureau** (also known as a consumer reporting agency) is an agency that provides a history of your reliability for your lines of credit. There are three major credit bureaus in the US:
  1. TransUnion
  2. Experian
  3. Equifax
* A **credit score** is a measure of how dependable you are as a borrower. It is usually issued by a credit bureau.
* A **credit report** is a detailed report of your credit history that is provided by a credit bureau.
* A lender will file an **inquiry** to look at your credit report when deciding whether to give you money or credit. There are two types of inquiries:
  * **Hard inquiries** stay on your credit report for two years.
  * **Soft inquiries** (which are often used for getting credit scores) do not show up on your credit report.

### Your goal: build credit.

In general, the simple way to build credit is to follow two rules:

1. Buy enough stuff, but not too much.
2. **Always pay your bills in full and on time.**

That itself doesn't say very much, though. There are two ways through which you can build credit:

* The most intuitive way of building credit is through **loans**, where a bank lends you money as credit with the understanding that you pay it back over time. This applies not only to loans for a car or a house, but also to student loans that you may have taken out while in school!
* A significantly easier method of building credit is with **credit cards**. In this case, an institution usually allows you to make purchases with a card up to a certain amount (the credit limit), and you pay a monthly bill for the amount you have spent on the card. This is known as **revolving credit** as the bank is not lending you a fixed amount of money, but rather is setting a cap on how much you can borrow at a time. If you pay some of the debt off, you can then borrow more.

As each person's financial situation is different, not everyone may be looking to take out loans after they graduate. For example, someone who lives in an urban area with high public transportation availability may not need a car. Therefore, I'll focus on credit cards as the more universal method of building credit.

### Applying for your first credit card

Assuming you currently have no open lines of credit (i.e., you have no credit history), the first step to building credit is to apply for a basic credit card that will not affect your spend habits and will allow you to build a credit history.

A good first credit card will have the following features:

* High acceptance rate (i.e., no credit score or history requirements)
* No annual fee (so you can keep it open without worries to build your credit history)
* 0% APR (so you can carry a balance if absolutely necessary; I **DO NOT** recommend doing this!)
* Good web/mobile interface to check balances and handle bills online
* Good customer service with high availability
* No foreign transaction fee
* Allows you to view your credit score (so you can see how you are building credit over time)

I personally recommend the **[Discover It For Students][11]** credit card as it satisfies all of the requirements listed above.

Once you have your first credit card, you should *keep it open for about a year* before you apply for other credit cards to ensure you have a stable credit history.

### Monitoring your credit score and credit report

Now that you have your first credit card, you have begun building a credit history. Furthermore, you now have a **credit score** that measures how dependable you are as a borrower. Your next goal should be to regularly pay off your bills in full and on time to build credit and increase your credit score.

Your credit score is affected by the following factors:

* High impact
    * Credit card utilization: try to keep to below 20% of limit
    * Payment history: always pay on time
    * Derogatory marks: don't get bankrupt
* Medium impact
    * Average age of credit history
    * Total number of accounts
* Low impact
    * Credit inquiries

To monitor how well you are building your credit, you can check your credit score with each of the three major bureaus for free with these online tools:

* [Credit Karma][12] for TransUnion
* [Credit Sesame][13] for Experian
* [Quizzle][14] for Equifax

Furthermore, each agency will provide you one free credit report per year, which you can obtain through [AnnualCreditReport.com][15]. You should do this every year and check your report for any discrepancies.

### Applying for more credit cards

After you have established a stable credit history for about a year, it's a good idea to apply for more credit cards to improve your credit history and score. As credit card utilization has a high impact on your score and total number of accounts has a medium impact, your score will go up.

**Note**: An important thing to know about applying for credit cards is that each application will cause your score to temporarily dip by 2-5 points. However, after a few months, your score should go back up to the same or even a higher level assuming you are financially responsible.

When choosing which cards to apply for, there are a few basic questions that you should consider:

* Do you mind paying an annual fee?
* Do you prefer cash back, airline miles, or rewards points?
* If you prefer rewards points, do you plan on redeeming them for travel?
* Will you be traveling internationally?

There are many credit cards out there that are targeted towards different financial audiences. However, I personally recommend the following two credit cards because they can be catered to anyone's spending habits.

* The [Chase Sapphire Preferred][16] is perhaps the top travel rewards card out there. It is a [Visa Signature][17] card with an annual fee of $95 that is waived the first year. It earns 2x points on travel and dining and 1x points on all other purchases and you can get a 25% bonus when you redeem points for travel (i.e., a cumulative rewards rate of 2.5%/1.25%). Furthermore, you can earn a signup bonus of *40000 points after spending $4000 in the first 3 months*.
    * [View from the Wing: The Best All-Around Credit Card is Chase Sapphire Preferred][18]
    * [The Points Guy: What’s the Best Way to Redeem Ultimate Rewards for Travel?][19]
    * [The Points Guy: Maximize Monday: Ranking the Chase Ultimate Rewards Transfer Partners][20]
* The [Barclaycard Arrival Plus][21] is an excellent all-around card for everyday spend. It is a [World Elite Mastercard][22] with an annual fee of $89 that is waived the first year. It earns 2% cash back on *all purchases*, and you can get a 10% bonus when you redeem points for travel (i.e., a cumulative cash back rate of 2.2%). Furthermore, you can earn a signup bonus of *40000 points after spending $3000 in the first 3 months*.
    * [The Points Guy: New Barclaycard Arrival Plus With Chip + PIN Capability][23]
    * [Million Mile Secrets: How to Redeem Barclaycard Arrival Plus Points for Travel][24]

In addition to the benefits listed above and detailed in the supplemental articles, an important thing to note about these two cards is that they are Visa and Mastercard, respectively, meaning **they will be accepted almost everywhere**.

A note about the *signup bonuses* for these two cards:

* For the Chase Sapphire Preferred, the 40000 points is worth at least $500 when you redeem for travel.
* For the Barclaycard Arrival Plus, the 40000 points is worth $440 when you redeem for travel.

In both cases, **the signup bonus alone offsets almost 5 years worth of the annual fee**.


After getting these two cards, you can always apply for additional cards. However, these two credit cards along with the Discover It for Students and your debit cards from Chase and Schwab form a solid foundation for accessing your money, building your credit history, and of course, making purchases.

## The misunderstood beast: filing taxes

Filing taxes seems to be an activity that causes everyone much panic and stress. However, it can actually be straightforward if you grasp a basic understanding of how the filing process works and if you use a software tool to file electronically.

### Tax returns and filing

Every year, you must file a **tax return** to the government indicating your income and assets as well as tax that you have paid already. The Internal Revenue Service then reviews the return and either collects money from you for the difference you owe or sends a refund check for the amount you overpaid.

The deadline to submit your tax return is always **April 15**. Your tax return details income, assets, and tax paid from the *previous year*. So, for example, a tax return that you filed on/before April 15, 2010 was for your finances for the year of 2009.

There are two types of tax returns that [almost everyone][25] must file:

* A **federal tax return** is the body of documents that determines whether or not you owe money as tax to the federal government.
* In addition, you must file a **state tax return** for any state in which you earn income (e.g., through a job or internship) as you may owe tax to that particular state as well.

### A note about required forms

As everyone's financial situation differs, some people may require many different forms to complete their tax forms. However, there are just a handful of essential forms that everyone should be familiar with:

#### Completed before filing
* **W-4**: Although not used while filing taxes, you usually complete this form when starting a job so that your employer withholds federal tax appropriately.
* **I-9**: Just like the W-4, you complete this form when starting employment to ensure that you are eligible to work and receive income.

#### Used while filing
* **W-2**: This form details the income you have received from a current or former employer. It also has information on the tax that has been withheld from that income.
* **1099-INT**: This form is usually issued by banks and indicates the amount of interest you have received from the bank for that year across all of your accounts with that bank.
* **Charity receipts**: As we'll see in the next major section, charitable donations are tax-deductible. Many charities will send you tax-exemption receipts after you contribute or statements indicating how much you contributed for the whole tax year.

### TaxACT: a straightforward software solution

Even with just the forms mentioned above, you might start to be a bit confused about which form is used for what purpose. Now if you think of all of the forms that could apply, it's easy to lose track of everything. Luckily, filing taxes has become significantly easier with the advent of software solutions that allow you to file electronically.

I personally recommend **[TaxACT][26]** because:

* It has an intuitive click-through flow.
* It will guide you in entering the information from the above forms in the appropriate locations in a way that matches the layout of the form itself.
* It will do a final check to make sure you haven't made any errors in your submission.
* It will notify you via text message and/or email if/when your return has been accepted or rejected.
    * As an example, The last couple of times I've filed my taxes, I received a text message confirmation that my return was accepted within a few days after filing, and I got my refund check within a week after filing.

Filing your federal tax return with TaxACT is free, and state tax returns cost $14.95 each.

## The Good Samaritan: charitable donations

As people start to make money, they often feel the urge to give back to charities to engage in the well-being of others that are less fortunate. Not only is this a noble effort, but it can play in your financial favor!

### Tax deductions through charitable donations

The key realization is that charities are classified as [501(c)(3) organizations, which are tax-exempt][27]. Therefore, any donation to such an organization is **tax-deductible**.

After a charity receives your donation, it will often send you a receipt of your donation that you should keep for tax purposes. On the other hand, some charities will send you a statement indicating how much you contributed for the entire tax year. You can enter the sum of all charitable donations for a tax year in a field on your tax return, and that amount (usually up [to 50% of your adjusted gross income][28]) is taken off of the tax that you owe the government.

### Donating effectively and the theory of charity investing

Most charities are worth your investment in them; however, many charities have been exposed as inefficient and corrupt. In addition, although we could donate a large amount to a single charity, most of us are passionate about many causes, so we might want to spread our donations out across multiple charities. This urge to maximize the impact of your donation is the motivation for what I call **charity investing**.

The goal is simple:

> Given a fixed amount of income per month, develop a "portfolio" of charities to donate consistently to every month for a pre-defined span of time.

In addition, similar to how you would approach investing in financial assets, we aim to meet the following criteria:

* **Diversify** your donation across:
  * Geographic regions
  * Geographic scope (local, domestic, international)
  * Issue sets
* Look for promotional offers where you can **match your gift** to multiply your donation. For example, UNICEF will occasionally have flash events sponsored by anonymous donors where they will triple your donation.
* Make sure the recipient of your donation is highly rated by organizations such as [Charity Navigator][29] that vet and audit charities.
* Use the credit cards that you've applied for from before to get cash back or rewards while you donate; it's a win-win!

#### A sample breakdown

Suppose I have **$100** to donate to charity for this month. I want to donate to a handful of organizations that touch both my local community as well as those that have international on-the-ground influence. I also want to address the issues of basic human health, water sanitation/access, and homelessness. Then the following distribution could be a solution:

* $40 to [UNICEF][30]
* $30 to [Watsi][31]
* $20 to [Charity: water][32]
* $10 to [Handup][33]

In addition, I've noticed that matching events happen relatively often for UNICEF and Charity: water, so it would make sense to wait until one of those events occurs before donating to those two organizations.
